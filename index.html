                To the living, I am gone.<br>
                To the sorrowful, I will never return.<br>
                To the angry, I was cheated.<br>
                To the happy, I am at peace.<br>
                And to the faithful, I have never left.<br>
                Though I cannot be seen, I can be heard.<br>
                So as you stand upon at the shore, gazing at the beatiful sea<br>
                Remember Me<br>
                Remember Me<br>
                As you look upon the tulip and admire its simplicity -<br>
                Remember Me<br>
                As you look at the color pink and all her different shades -<br>
                Remember Me<br>
                As you watch Holiday movies on Lifetime or Hallmark; <br>
                As you pass by or attend the Devon Horse show; <br>
                As you stop in or pass by a Starbucks; <br>
                Or if you ever hear the name Frodo - 
                Remember Me<br> 
                As you run reports or type entries in Juris; <br>
                As you use work stationery; <br>
                As you pass by my office; <br>
                Or as you read our quarterly newsletter, The Bulletin; <br>
                Remember Me<br>
                As you watch World News Tonight with David Muir; <br>
                As you watch any movie with Viggo Mortensen; <br>
                As you watch the movie, "War of the Worlds" -
                Remember Me<br>
                As you celebrate my favorite holiday, <br>
                the creepy and haunting Halloween - <br> 
                Remember Me<br>
               <br><hr>
                 <br><div id="break">To My KTMC Family... </div><br>
                 As you attend holiday parties at The Paramour; <br>
                 When you hear a winter storm is coming - <br>
                 Remember Me<br>
                And as you continue to play Powerball and Mega Millions - <br>  
                Remember Me<br><br>
                Back in February, Kathy shared with me a dream that our group won <br>
                and shared again with me on July 3rd. <br>
                Kathy said, 'my dreams come true, so don't give up!' <br><br>
                Remember Kathy in your heart <br> 
                Your thoughts, your memories of: <br> 
                - the times we loved, <br>
                - the times we cried, <br>
                - the times we fought, <br>
                - the times we laughed, <br> <br>
                For if you always think of her, she will never be gone.<br>
                Remember Me<br>
                Remember Me<br>
                Remember Me <br><br><br><br>

                <div id="memPtitle4"> Kathy, may you always rest in peace. </div> <br>
